NAME
    Config::Any::Merge - Overrinding of configuration variables based on
    file order

VERSION
    Version 0.07

DESCRIPTION
    Config::Any returns your configuration as a hash of hashes keyed by the
    name of the configuration file. This module merges these hashes into a
    single hash. If the "override" paramter is set to 0 in the paramters for
    "load_files" or "load_stems", configurations files later in the list
    can't override variables that are already set. The default is to
    override previous set variables. In all other regards Config::Any::Merge
    is a strict subclass of Config::Any and inherits all of its functions.

SYNOPSIS
        use Config::Any::Merge;

        my $cfg = Config::Any->load_files({files => \@filepaths, override => 0, ...  });
